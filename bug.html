I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had correctly installed and configured Tailwind, and the classes were being included in my HTML, but they had no visual effect. I inspected the HTML elements in my browser's developer tools and confirmed the Tailwind classes were present, but the corresponding styles weren't applied.
