The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind directives in my `tailwind.config.js` correctly pointed to the content directory containing my HTML files.  The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` needed to include the path to the files where I was using Tailwind classes.  Once the path was added and I re-ran the build process, the Tailwind styles were correctly applied.  If you're using a build process (like Vite, Webpack, etc.), make sure Tailwind's postcss plugins are correctly configured and the build process is correctly generating the Tailwind CSS output.
