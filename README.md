This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles fail to apply despite correctly added classes. The `bug.html` file shows the initial problematic code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version. The issue stems from a common oversight in Tailwind's configuration or integration with the build process.  The solution involves verifying the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`), ensuring the CSS file is correctly linked, and potentially addressing build process issues.  The example highlights a typical scenario encountered by developers, focusing on the HTML and CSS aspects of Tailwind integration.
